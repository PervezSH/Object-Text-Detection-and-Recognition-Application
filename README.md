# Object-Text-Detection-and-Recognition-Application

The proposed system is composed of object â€“ text detection and dimensioning network and text recognition network. This system presents an enhanced technique for detecting objects and computing their measurements in real  time from video streams. The proposed system use OpenCV  libraries, which includes the canny edge detection, dilation, and erosion algorithms. Tesseract OCR engine is employed to deal with the text recognition task.
